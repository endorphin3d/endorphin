# Endorphin

This is the repo for both the CAD files and the docs for the Endorphin project. Docs are built and published [here](https://endorphin3d.com/docs).

### Docs

The docs are built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Just the Docs](https://justtheocs.com/).

To serve the docs locally, run:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:4000`.
